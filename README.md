# Simple pomodoro app

This is a very simple pomodoro app. 

## Why?

* Couldn't find pomodoro app that has a focus field. Forcing user to write down area of focus beforehand clarifies the goal (at least I hope so)
* Just for fun

 Almost vanilla js - no other dependencies but those that came along with the template.

 Why name "give me focus"? Because let me focus domain was reserved :).
